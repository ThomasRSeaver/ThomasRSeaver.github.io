<h2>Pelé</h2>
<p>
    Edson Arantes do Nascimento, known universally as Pelé, is often considered the greatest soccer player in history. Hailing from Brazil, he rose to international fame at just 17 during the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he dazzled the world with his extraordinary goal-scoring ability and on-field artistry. Over his illustrious career, he is credited with scoring more than 1,000 goals, a record that remains a testament to his prolific talent. Pelé's legacy is further cemented by his unparalleled achievement of winning three World Cups with the Brazilian national team, a feat no other player has matched. Beyond his statistics, he was a global ambassador for the sport, profoundly influencing its popularity and setting enduring standards for future generations of athletes. His style of play was a blend of skill, vision, and acrobatic finishes, earning him the nickname "The King." He retired in 1977, leaving behind a legacy of dominance and sportsmanship that continues to inspire.

<h2>Diego Maradona</h2>
<p>
    Diego Maradona was a captivating and complex figure in the world of soccer, celebrated for his genius on the field and his larger-than-life personality. The Argentine midfielder's rise from a poor neighborhood to superstardom is the stuff of legend. He possessed an unmatched flair and control on the ball, with his dribbling ability often leaving opponents in his wake. His most iconic performance came during the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where he almost single-handedly led Argentina to victory. This tournament featured two of his most famous moments: the controversial "Hand of God" goal and the breathtaking "Goal of the Century," a masterful solo run from his own half that saw him bypass multiple English players before scoring. Despite personal struggles off the field, Maradona remains a symbol of passion and a footballing god to many. His creative vision and ability to dominate games from the midfield solidified his place among the all-time greats.
